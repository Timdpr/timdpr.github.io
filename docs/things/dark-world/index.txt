e:Te66,<p>edited by Tim Parker Russell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Included are fourteen stories from around the world, most of which have been specially written for this collection. There is an intriguing story from Jayaprakash Satyamurthy set in Bangalore and Dubai, and a beautiful tale from Christopher Fowler about an Indian palace. In Reggie Oliver's 'Come Into My Parlour', horrors are closer to home, while Stephen Holman locates his unsettling story in a Los Angeles arts academy. Anna Taborska mixes old legends and the present day in Eastern Europe, and Mark Valentine sets his well-woven mystery somewhere in Northamptonshire. Rosalie Parker's 'Oracle' takes place in the Yorkshire Dales. It captures well the feel of the countryside---and how it can affect you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>'I use the term "ghost story" loosely. You will find inside this book a varied selection of creepy tales, very few of which could be considered conventional. I hope you enjoy reading Dark World as much as I've enjoyed editing it.'</p>

<p>Note: All profits from Dark World, will be used to help the Amala Children's Home, funding a three-week working trip in July 2013, and being donated directly to the cause. Located in the Tamil Nadu region of India, the home provides accommodation, food, safety and schooling for orphans and severely disadvantaged children. Without it, these children would be living on the streets of India, with the immense hardships and danger that brings.</p>

<h3>Reviews</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>'Whether they provide their ghosts with a rationale for appearing, or present them as frightening because they are inexplicable, all the authors exercise restraint in their storytelling that encourages readers to fit their own worst fears to the story's supernatural events. This anthology, whose proceeds will benefit the Amala Children's Home of India, is Russell's first, but it shows a seasoned editor's understanding of effective weird tale telling.' <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-905784-53-0"><em>Publishers Weekly</em></a></p>
