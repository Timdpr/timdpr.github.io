      <title>Does neural synchrony imply image familiarity in an ant&#39;s brain?</title>

        <description>Ants use visual information to quickly and accurately learn routes through their environment, despite a small brain and a low-resolution visual system. This navigation may be driven by a search for familiarity between a current view and the views previously experienced along the target route. There is little consensus on how this familiarity measure is implemented, but a recently proposed general familiarity measure, whereby an input history is encoded in a spiking neural network and the synchrony of spike timing is measured for a new input, seems promising.</description>
